# WWESmackDown
stripped down dll base for a shitty wrestling game for an equally shitty person that tried to screw me over.

This project was started in an attempt to help someone with a project they have been working on for a very long time. This person was well known in the community to be a leach and would request high level code for nothing in return while continually badgering those that were willing to lend a helping hand. Against my better judgement, I decided to help out for a fee; we decided on a monetary percentage based on the sale of each tool sold utilizing this dll. The individual in question decided to back out of the deal but still wanted the dll to which I stated the price would henceforth be $200 OR I would release it as open source. If you are reading this, you obviously see the decision that was made. Feel free to call me "petty" or a "drama starter" (his words) but I have dealt with this individual in the past and refuse to be taken advantage of.  
 
I have stripped this source of all offsets because yes, I am that petty. Maybe someday I will release them,regardless I am more than done with this project. 
 
Overall, this is a good base for a dll if you want to start your own sort of project like it, if you have any questions I am more than willing to help! find me on Discord! @Cain532#0532 Happy Modding~!
